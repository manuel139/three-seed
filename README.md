This is a work in progress and a fork of my pixi-seed repo.

* `npm run build` - Run a production build, outputs to ./build/
* `npm run lint` - Lint your code

## Static assets

`import` asset files from within your JavaScript component files:

```javascript
// Filename: app.js
import assetURL from './logo.png';
```
